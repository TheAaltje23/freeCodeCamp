                <h3>Here's a time line of Muhammad Ali's life:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="year">1942</span> - Cassius Clay, Jr. is born to Odessa and Cassius Clay, Sr. at
                        the Louisville General Hospital
                        in South Louisville. Two years later, brother Rudy (later Rahaman Ali) is born, and soon
                        the family moves into the Parkland neighborhood.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="year">1957</span> - Cassius struggles academically (he was later diagnosed with
                        dyslexia) but becomes a school celebrity for his dedication to training, including running to
                        school every day
                        alongside the bus. He would visit the school as a hero after the Rome Olympic Games and
                        his legacy remains a point of Central pride.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="year">1960</span> - Three months out of high school, Ali competes at the 1960
                        Summer Olympics in Rome. Despite being afraid of
                        airplanes, Ali boards the flight while wearing an army
                        surplus parachute. He wins the light-heavyweight gold
                        medal, defeating Zbigniew Pietrzykowski of Poland.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="year">1964</span> - In his first heavyweight title bout, Ali is a longshot to
                        defeat
                        Liston, widely seen as unstoppable. Nonetheless, Ali
                        predicts “a total eclipse of the Sonny”—and indeed Liston
                        does not rise to the seventh round's opening bell. “I'm the
                        greatest! I shook up the world!”
                        Win - Technical Knockout in 6 rounds [Miami Beach]
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="year">1967</span> - Football star Jim Brown organizes a summit of 12 leading Black
                        athletes, including Kareem
                        Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Russell, to meet with Ali and discuss his position on the draft. Most
                        were veterans themselves, and several arrived intending to change Ali's mind. However,
                        the group emerged expressing support for Ali's position.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="year">1970</span> - This fight was not approved by Georgia governor Lester Maddox,
                        a segregationist who
                        declared a “day of mourning” over it. However, only Atlanta Mayor Sam Massell's approval
                        was necessary, secured through the efforts of State Senator Leroy Johnson. Ali previewed
                        the fight in a drawing to Leroy Nieman, where Maddox is drawn running down the back
                        right aisle, yelling "Stop that fight!"
                        Win - Technical Knockout in 3 rounds [Atlanta, Georgia]
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="year">1971</span> - In a chance to reclaim his title, Ali's first heavyweight fight
                        with Frazier matched two
                        undefeated fighters. However, Ali's three years away from the ring made the difference in
                        a grueling 15 rounds. It is Ali's first defeat and the start of the greatest rivalry in boxing
                        history.
                        Loss - Unanimous Decision in 15 rounds [New York City]
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="year">1974</span> - Although Joe Frazier no longer held the title of Heavyweight
                        Champion, Muhammad Ali
                        wanted to face him again to prove he was indeed “the Greatest.” Billed as “Super Fight II,”
                        the match went the distance of 12 rounds and ultimately led to a unanimous decision in
                        favor of Ali.
                        Win - Unanimous Decision in 12 rounds [New York City]
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="year">1974</span> - A showdown in Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the
                        Congo) to reclaim Ali's heavyweight title puts him against
                        Foreman, the imposing favorite. Ali employs his
                        “rope-a-dope” tactic: leaning on the ropes, Ali absorbs
                        body blows until Foreman finally wears himself out. The
                        fight held cultural impact for the people of Zaire, who
                        connected with Ali, as well as the millions who watched the
                        fight around the world.
                        Win - Knockout in 8 rounds [Kinshasa, Zaire]
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="year">1975</span> - Ali meets Frazier in the final installment of this storied
                        boxing rivalry, and one of the most grueling but best
                        displays of the sport. It was the fight Ali said was the closest
                        he's ever been to dying. Both fighters faded fast toward the
                        end, but it was Frazier's corner who conceded in round 14.
                        Win - Technical Knockout in 14 rounds [Quezon City,
                        Philippines]
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="year">1978</span> - Ali's self-appointed title of “The Greatest” is solidified in a
                        Spinks rematch at The Superdome in New Orleans. The
                        event has the then-highest attendance ever for an indoor
                        bout. Ali takes the world heavyweight championship for a
                        third time—a first in boxing history.
                        Win - Unanimous Decision in 15 rounds [New Orleans,
                        Louisiana]
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="year">1990</span> - Despite warnings, Ali travels to Baghdad, Iraq to negotiate
                        the release of 15 United States hostages taken during the
                        Kuwait invasion. Ali meets with Saddam Hussein for nearly
                        an hour and successfully secures the hostages' release.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="year">1996</span> - In an opening ceremony surprise, with undisguised
                        challenges holding the torch and yet focused and precise,
                        Ali lights the Olympic cauldron in a moment that captivates
                        3.5 billion worldwide viewers.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="year">2001</span> - Days after the devastating attacks of September 11, Ali
                        travels to Ground Zero to thank first responders and share
                        a message of peace in the face of xenophobia and Islamic
                        extremist terrorism.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="year">2005</span> - President George W. Bush awards Ali with the highest civilian
                        honor in the United States:
                        “Across the world, billions of people know Muhammad Ali as a brave, compassionate and
                        charming man, and the American people are proud to call Muhammad Ali one of our
                        own.”
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="year">2016</span> - Muhammad Ali passes away late in the evening in Scottsdale,
                        Arizona due to respiratory
                        complications. He was 74.

                <p class="quote">"Impossible is just a word thrown around by small men who find it easier to live in the
                    world they've been given than to explore the power they have to change it. Impossible is not a fact.
                    It's an opinion. Impossible is potential. Impossible is temporary. Impossible is nothing."
